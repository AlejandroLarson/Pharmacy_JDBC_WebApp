The prescription database allows pharmacies to track prescriptions made by patients and also
documents information about patients and their doctors. This is intended to interact with a web
application with various forms that users can fill out to interact with the database. Multiple
pharmacies with different drug prices are accounted for and patients are able to fill their
prescriptions as needed. The database also keeps track of the number of refills.
